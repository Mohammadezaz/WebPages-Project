        <h2>About Gulmarg</h2>
        <p>
            Gulmarg is Kashmir’s unique ski area. It’s big mountain nirvana, skiing massive gondola assisted
             back country runs, deep powder, superb trees or wide open alpine slopes, Kashmiri culture, great 
             food and when it’s snowing, some exquisite 4WD taxi, or touring through trees. It’s a powder 
             skiing paradise and there’s never the need to do nothing, unless you are tired of course. I’ve 
             been touring in Gulmarg for eight years and just love the pace.Below is some information, but 
             the main point is YOU NEED A GUIDE to explore Gulmarg’s pristine skiing safely, even if you have 
             a wealth of back country experience and I suggest a qualified Westerner with experience in 
             Gulmarg. Your decision on who and how much you want to pay will dictate the outcome, safety and
              quality of your trip. It is not a place to skimp on safety!

        <h2>Beauty,Nature of Gulmarg</h2>
        <p>
            Gulmarg is a town nestled in the Pir Panjal range of the Western Himalayas at an altitude of 8,690 
            feet above sea level. Literally translated as ‘Meadow of Flowers’ it is encased by glimmering snow 
            peaked alps, verdant green pastures, colorful meadows, deep valleys and pine covered slopes.

A picturesque beauty, it is known for its ski resort which was established in 1927, the Gulmarg Gondola – 
Asia’s second longest cable car ride and the highest golf course in the world at an elevated altitude of 2,650
 meters. Gulmarg is an absolute delight for nature lovers and adventure seekers. Called the ‘heartland of 
 winter sports’, it offers a plethora of activities such as skiing, snowboarding, horse riding, heli-skiing, 
 snow scooter, tobogganing, etc. and sightseeing options. The best season to visit Gulmarg is from October to 
 June as it is the perfect destination especially during winters when the snow capped landscape transforms 
 into the premier destination for winter sports in India.
