              <h2>Freedom Fighter OF INDIA</h2>
              <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
                   nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful 
                   campaign for India's independence from British rule and later inspire movements for civil rights 
                   and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), 
                   first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.Born and raised in 
                   a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was 
                   called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable 
                   to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian 
                   merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi 
                   raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, 
                   aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban 
                   labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.
